                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For Interns</h2>
                <p>In Askked, We giv intrnship opportunities to freshers or people and stuents who want to work with industry and gain experience; I reflected on how graduate students in psychology and related disciplines may begin to view logging clinical hours as a more meaningful endeavor. Building on that notion, this post explores the features of an effective practicum or internship plan.

                    The post is written based on the big idea that the development of a studentâ€™s professional skills should be treated as an integrated process, not a series of isolated activities. The content is adapted from my book Demystifying the School Psychology Internship: A Dynamic Guide for Interns and Supervisors.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Although having a wide range of experiences during the field experience is important, it may also be considered important for students to pursue one or more areas in greater depth.

                    The concept of depth is expansive and can mean gaining conceptual and applied knowledge with a specific population, in a particular domain of practice, in one or more competencies subsuming a domain of practice, or an integrated combination of all of these. To achieve depth in a given area, students require sufficient content knowledge and multiple and differential opportunities for practice.
                    
                    The development of practicum or internship goals and a plan provide an ideal opportunity for students to determine a specialized area of interest to pursue in greater depth than other areas. Students and supervisors should bear in mind that breadth and depth are not mutually exclusive; students can participate in a number and variety of experiences and simultaneously seek out one or more areas more extensively than others.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A practicum or internship plan provides a guide to navigate the field experience from beginning to end.

                    Like a driver traveling in a new city without a map or GPS, students and supervisors who do not plan for the field experience risk driving along aimlessly and getting lost along the way.
                    
                    It is my hope that the features described in this post will help students and supervisors to engage in practicum and internship planning that is integrated, pragmatic and developmentally driven.
